	<b>Scientific name:</b> Canis lupus familiaris<br><b>Phylum:</b> Chordata<br><b>Rank:</b> Subspecies<br><b>Lifespan:</b> 10-13 years<br><br>
	 It is  known that the dog was the first domesticat species .The domestic dog is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The closest living relative of the dog is the gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage. The dog and the extant gray wolf form two sister clades, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticat.</p></p>
